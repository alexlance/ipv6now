IPv6 technical definitions available.

<p>
It covers IPv6 addresses, prefixes, packet structure, address types,
multicast, ICMPv6, autoconfiguration, DNS, transition, security, mobility, and
tools. This expanded Second Edition also has new sections on tunnel techniques

<h4>T-Shirts are great</h4>
<p>
Okay we admit it, you're going to have to be a pretty special sort of person
to wear a t-shirt that proclaims your IPv6 preference for the world to see...
</p>
<p>
But that's ok. We think you're great. Don't forget to buy one for your mum.
