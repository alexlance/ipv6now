<h4>The business case for IPv6? It's called the Internet.</h4>

<p>
With IPv6, network management is simpler and cheaper. Security and
mobility are improved, cloud and IoT networks enabled, and innovation enhanced.
The old IPv4 system is over, and without IPv6 new network expansion is limited,
new features cannot be exploited, and new markets will become unreachable.  
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Internet of Things cannot happen without IPv6.</li>
<li>Massive-scale cloud computing cannot happen without IPv6.</li>
<li>Governments and trading partners are actively adopting IPv6. </li>
<li>Using IPv6 is a low-cost business continuity strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Internet is basic to the survival of any modern business, and management is
ultimately responsible for service delivery and the bottom line.

<h4>Isn't IPv6 just techie plumbing?</h4> 

Think about how much your business invests in computers and networks.
Do you really want to leave it up to the techies to decide what happens to it?
Strategic development starts at the top.

<h4>IPv6 is on and you have no idea</h4>

Today IPv6 is on by default, and can be used to bypass your security
policies (accidently or deliberately). If you think your network's not carrying
IPv6, it just means you don't know about it. 

<h4>Plan with IPv6 Now</h4>

PLAN your IPv6 transition. Don't let a crisis force you into over-spending on
inadequate design, training and installation:

<ul>
<li>Survey: analyse your current progress in IPv6 adoption </li>
<li>Inventory: find out what hardware and software is IPv6-ready</li>
</ul>
