<h4>Use IPv6</h4>
<p>
Now you have completed the initial planning. Your management understands the
strategic implications. You know what stage of progress in IPv6 adoption you
have reached. You have an inventory of the IPv6 status of your hardware and
software. Your staff have undergone the appropriate technical training. You
have analysed and chosen a transition pathway...
</p>
<p>
The next step is to actually implement IPv6. Specific stages will depend upon
the environment-specific conclusions of your IPv6 planning and training. IPv6
Now can help you work through the subsequent stages below.
</p>


<h4>Implementing IPv6</h4>

<ul>
<li>Define the scope of the initial installation: e.g. proof of concept network,
internal or external networks, dual-stack or IPv6-only components, etc.

<li>Consult Best Practices RFC documents and case studies for similar
organisations. 

<li>Apply for a range of IPv6 address space from your service provider or Regional
Registry.

<li>Design the new IPv6 address structure, taking into account future extensibility
and current configurations (without being restricted by them).

<li>Map and document the routing topology and ingress and egress points to provider
networks.

<li>Examine IPv6 address management (IPAM) packages for local suitability.

<li>Configure IPv6 in firewall, monitoring and intrusion detection systems. 

<li>Become familiar with IPv6 connectivity and validation tools. Set up a testing
regime appropriate for your computing environment. 

<li>Set up progress milestones and reporting.
</ul>
